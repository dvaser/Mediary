### Sprint Review

> As a team, we decided to develop a product in the healthcare domain. Our project focuses on diseases within Internal Medicine.  
> The primary goal is to automate diagnosis, test recommendation, result interpretation, and final evaluation processes, starting from the patient's medical history with AI support.

Key decisions made:  
- The user interface will be a 'website'.  
- We gathered all available medical data and resources related to Internal Medicine.  
- A disease–test mapping table was created based on the collected data.  
- The significance of test values, including lower and upper reference limits, was analyzed.
