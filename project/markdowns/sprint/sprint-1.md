* **Sprint Review:**

  * As a team, we first decided to develop a product in the healthcare domain.
    
  * We initially had difficulty choosing a name for the application. Eventually, we decided to combine the words "Medical" and "Diary", and agreed on the name Mediary.
    
  * Doğukan and Zeynep worked on creating the patient–test mapping table, and as a team we agreed to continue working on this table in the next sprint.
    
  * The two biggest challenges we faced during this sprint were accessing sufficient data in the field of Internal Medicine and analyzing the collected data effectively.
    
  * Overall, we believe we had a productive sprint. The process closely followed our initial sprint plan.
