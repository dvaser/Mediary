## Project Name
Mediary


## Project Purpose

The aim is to automate processes such as diagnosing based on patient history, recommending tests, interpreting results, and providing personalized health assessments with the support of artificial intelligence.

The project aims to provide clinical decision support for doctors, offer preliminary information to patients, and reduce the workload within the healthcare system.

In the initial phase of the project, the data collection process has been focused on the field of Internal Medicine; therefore, diseases specific to this area will be prioritized for evaluation. In later stages, data will also be gathered from other medical specialties, aiming to obtain stronger insights into a broader range of health conditions.

- **Sprint Review**

First, as a team, we decided to develop a product in the healthcare field. Accordingly, the general framework of our project was defined as follows:
Our project is designed around diseases in the field of Internal Medicine. The primary goal is to automate the processes of diagnosis, test recommendation, result interpretation, and final evaluation with the support of artificial intelligence, starting from the patient’s medical history.

The key decisions made can be summarized as follows:
  * It was decided to proceed with a website as the user interface.
  * We attempted to access all available medical data and resources related to Internal Medicine.
  * Based on these data, a disease–test mapping table was created.
  * The significance of test values was analyzed, including their lower and upper reference limits.

- **Sprint Retrospective:**

Throughout the sprint process, an equal and balanced distribution of work was maintained within the team. Each member fulfilled their responsibilities, resulting in an efficient collaborative workflow.

  - One team member focused on developing the web interface.
  - Two team members gathered medical data and resources related to Internal Medicine, preparing the data infrastructure.
  - The remaining two members analyzed the collected data to produce meaningful insights and created informational tables that could serve as a foundation for the project.

Communication within the team was consistent, task allocation was clear, and everyone met their responsibilities. By the end of the sprint, the targeted milestones were successfully achieved.
