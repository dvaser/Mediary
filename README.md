## Project Purpose

> The aim is to automate processes such as diagnosing based on patient history, recommending tests, interpreting results, and providing personalized health assessments with the support of artificial intelligence.
>
> The project aims to provide clinical decision support for doctors, offer preliminary information to patients, and reduce the workload within the healthcare system.
>
> In the initial phase of the project, the data collection process has been focused on the field of Internal Medicine; therefore, diseases specific to this area will be prioritized for evaluation. In later stages, data will also be gathered from other medical specialties, aiming to obtain stronger insights into a broader range of health conditions.
